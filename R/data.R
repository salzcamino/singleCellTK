#' Example Single Cell RNA-Seq data in SCtkExperiment Object, GSE60361
#' subset
#'
#' A subset of 30 samples from a single cell RNA-Seq experiment from Zeisel, et
#' al. Science 2015. The data was produced from cells from the mouse
#' somatosensory cortex (S1) and hippocampus (CA1). 15 of the cells were
#' identified as oligodendrocytes and 15 of the cell were identified as
#' microglia.

#' The following unfiltered PBMC_1k_v3 data were downloaded from

#' Only the top 10 cells with most counts and the last 10 cells with non-zero
#' counts are included in this example.
#' This example only serves as a proof of concept and a tutoriol on how to
#' run the functions in this package. The results should not be
#' used for drawing scientific conclusions.

#' Example Single Cell RNA-Seq data in SingleCellExperiment object, with
#' different batches annotated
#'
#' Two batches of pancreas scRNAseq dataset are combined with their original
#' counts. Cell types and batches are annotated in `colData(sceBatches)`.
#' Two batches came from Wang, et al., 2016, annotated as `'w'`; and Xin, et
#' al., 2016, annotated as `'x'`. Two common cell types, `'alpha'` and 
#' `'beta'`, that could be found in both original studies with relatively 
#' large population were kept for cleaner demonstration.
