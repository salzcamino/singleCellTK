\description{
Two batches of pancreas scRNAseq dataset are combined with their original
counts. Cell types and batches are annotated in `colData(sceBatches)`.
Two batches came from Wang, et al., 2016, annotated as `'w'`; and Xin, et
al., 2016, annotated as `'x'`. Two common cell types, `'alpha'` and 
`'beta'`, that could be found in both original studies with relatively 
large population were kept for cleaner demonstration.
