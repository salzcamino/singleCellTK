\title{Apply Integration batch effect correction method from Seurat v3 to 
SingleCellExperiment object}
\usage{
runSeurat3Integration(
  inSCE,
  useAssay = "logcounts",
  batch = "batch",
  assayName = "Seurat3Int",
  nAnchors = nrow(inSCE),
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{inSCE}{SingleCellExperiment object. An object that stores your dataset
and analysis procedures.}

\item{useAssay}{character, default `"logcounts"`. A string indicating the name 
of the assay requiring batch correction in "inSCE", should exist in 
`assayNames(inSCE)`.}

\item{batch}{character, default `"batch"`. A string indicating the 
field of `colData(inSCE)` that defines different batches.}

\item{assayName}{character, default `"Seurat3Int"`. The name for the 
corrected full-sized expression matrix. If the number of features returned 
is smaller the number of total feature, the returned matrix will be saved in 
`reducedDim(inSCE, assayName)`; if equal, `assay(inSCE, assayName)`.}

\item{nAnchors}{integer, default `nrow(inSCE)`. The number of features to 
anchor, and also the final dimensionality of the integrated matrix. Thus 
default value turns to produce full-sized assay.}

\item{verbose}{bool, default `TRUE`. Whether to show detail information of 
the process.}
}
\description{
Can get either a full-sized corrected assay or a dimension reduced corrected 
matrix.
}
\details{
This method aims to first identify anchors between pairs of datasets, that 
represent pairwise correspondences between individual cells in each 
dataset, that is hypothesized to originate from the same cell state. These 
anchors are then used to harmonize the datasets, or transfer information 
from one dataset to another.
